# shoestringMergeSort

This project was developed over the course of a 2-day Digital Shoestring hackathon by our 4-member team (12-13 February 2022).

Our project proposes a solution to inventory management in supermarkets.
Instead of scanning for empty gaps in shelves that need to be restocked, we weigh the weight on each shelf and determine the number of items still on the shelf.
This helps us alert the management to restock shelves when they are critically low, as well as plot historic data and predict future demand and certain points in the day or the week.
